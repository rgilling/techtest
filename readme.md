# Instructions

1. Install node runtime if not alrady available.
2. Unzip this project into a directory.
3. cd to that directory
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run test`

# Notes
1. I set up a stub mechanism so the service resolves some test data when running in mock mode. See wms.js.
2. I also showed some example code calling the service.
3. In production we wouldn't store an API password in the repository.
